Hey everyone! Here I'll be detailing my projects and experiences here in write ups! I realised I have a lot of things I've been doing but I haven't properly written my thoughts down anywhere. Hopefully this is a space I can use to track my progress and hopefully share my experiences! This will be my first post, but for my earlier experiences, I'll backdate so it appears in chronological order.

## About Me

I am a year 3 computer science major at NUS. I'm interested in machine learning and how computers can do cool stuff. I love all things bouldering, exploring new things, as well as photography and videography! I have small interests in doing latte art, and I love a good matcha (I'm not performative I actually like it!).

## Why Did I Make This?

I am STRUGGLING to find an internship. Over the past 2 years, I've been focused on school work and student life, yet I've been neglecting to do personal projects and extracurriculars... and I think I am finding out the hard way that those are the tickets to get an internship in this day and age. So - creating a personal portfolio seems like a great way to explore web dev, along with showing off what I've done in the process!

## List of My Experiences (in chronological order):
I'm going to try write a blog for every experience/project I had!
