hey everyone! here i'll be detailing my projects and experiences here in write ups! i realised i have a lot of things i've been doing but i haven't properly written my thoughts down anywhere. hopefully this is a space i can use to track my progress and hopefully share my experiences! this will be my first post, but for my earlier experiences, i'll backdate so it appears in chronological order.

## about me

i am a year 3 computer science major at nus. i'm interested in machine learning and how computers can do cool stuff. i love all things bouldering, exploring new things, as well as photography and videography! i have small interests in doing latte art, and i love a good matcha (i'm not performative i actually like it!).

## why did i make this?

i am STRUGGLING to find an internship. over the past 2 years, i've been focused on school work and student life, yet i've been neglecting to do personal projects and extracurriculars... and i think i am finding out the hard way that those are the tickets to get an internship in this day and age. so - creating a personal portfolio seems like a great way to explore web dev, along with showing off what i've done in the process!

## list of my experiences (in chronological order):
i'm going to try write a blog for every experience/project i had!
