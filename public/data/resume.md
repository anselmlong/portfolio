## Experience

**Machine Learning Intern, IMDA** — Infocomm Media Development Authority, Singapore (May 2025 – Aug 2025)

* Researched and evaluated eight anomaly detection models, identifying the optimal one based on F1-score, speed, and interpretability.
* Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies, achieving a near-perfect F1-score of **0.994**.
* Used Explainable AI (LIME) and feature importance analysis to improve model transparency and stakeholder confidence.
* Designed and implemented a modular machine learning pipeline for data parsing, feature engineering, model training, and explainability, enabling rapid model iteration and reproducibility.
* Engineered 32 analytical features (e.g., certificate lifetime, domain entropy, issuer reputation) from 3 million SSL/TLS certificate records, improving model interpretability and eliminating redundant variables.
* Researched and evaluated eight anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF, K-Means, Random Forest, Half-Space Trees, Graph Convolution Networks, and LLM embeddings), narrowing to one optimal model through quantitative comparisons of F1-score, speed, and explainability.
* Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies across all shortlisted models to maximize performance and generalization on unseen datasets, achieving a best, near-perfect F1-score of 0.994.
* Assessed the predictions of various models using Explainable AI (LIME) and feature importance analysis to surface key predictive features, improving transparency and stakeholder confidence in anomaly classification.
* Bridged cybersecurity and machine learning by applying unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms to detect certificate-based threats, contributing to enhanced cyber threat intelligence.
* Documented model evaluation framework and decision rationale, ensuring future teams can reproduce, audit, and extend experimental results efficiently.
* Performed in-depth data analysis on model outputs and feature distributions to identify key behavioral trends in SSL/TLS certificate data, enabling data-driven model refinement and improved anomaly detection accuracy.


**Strategic Digital Projects Intern, IMDA** — Infocomm Media Development Authority, Singapore (May 2024 – Aug 2024)
