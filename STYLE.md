# Writing Style Analysis - Anselm Long

## Tone & Voice
- **Casual and conversational**: "Hey everyone", "What dumb project did I do again?", "Lowkey, I seem to have a knack for useless projects", "Alright"
- **Self-deprecating humor**: Admits mistakes openly, uses phrases like "useless side project"
- **Honest about struggles**: "This was a fun but very painful project", "I kept running into out of memory errors"
- **Relatable frustration**: "aw hell nah i ain't waiting 38 hours", "Nooooo..."
- **Enthusiastic when things work**: "THIS ACTUALLY SOUNDS LEGIT-ish!!!", "Such a mood. Wow. This is me."
- **Accepts limitations**: "I've kinda resigned to my fate that my laptop is just slow"
- **Casual dismissals**: "(don't ask why it's named that way)", "duh!"
- **Data-driven but casual**: Can present statistics and analysis while maintaining conversational tone
- **Observational**: "ChatSelm is eerily similar to me"

## Structure Patterns
- **TL;DR section** at the top for quick summary (when applicable)
- **Visual-first opening**: Video or image at the top with caption
- **Numbered/sequential steps**: "First Step", "Second", "Third", etc. OR just "1.", "2.", "3."
- **Iterative documentation**: "First Run", "Second Run", "Third Run" showing the journey
- **Interactive elements**: "See if you can guess which is mine!", quizzes, answer keys
- **Data presentation**: Extensive use of tables for comparisons, results, statistics
- **Methodology sections**: Explains how experiments/evaluations were conducted
- **Answer keys**: Provided at the end for interactive content
- **Spoiler warnings**: "I'll spoil it in the next section anyway"
- **"Learning points!" section** at the end (alternative to "Reflections")
- **References section** with numbered list (when applicable)
- **Clear section headers** that are descriptive but casual, sometimes with uncertainty: "It Works... Generally!"
- **GitHub repo links** early in the post
- **Call to action**: "Let me know how many you get correct!"

## Language Patterns
- **Frequent contractions**: "I'm", "it's", "don't", "can't", "won't"
- **Casual interjections**: "lolz", "HAHAHAHAAA", "aw hell nah", "duh!"
- **Opening phrases**: "Lowkey", "Hey everyone", "What dumb project did I do again?", "Alright"
- **Transitional phrases**: "But without Further Ado", "Great - now I had my data", "At this point", "Eventually", "Needless to say", "In the end"
- **Sentence starters**: "So!", "Great -", "Unfortunately", "Now,", "Out of the box"
- **Parenthetical asides**: Frequent use of parentheses for clarifications and side thoughts: "(don't ask why it's named that way)", "(duh!)", "(i.e. I'm in Singapore)"
- **Rhetorical questions**: Used sparingly but effectively
- **Casual qualifiers**: "kinda", "lowkey", "honestly", "I think"
- **Accepting limitations**: "I've kinda resigned to my fate"
- **Statistical language**: "28.2% (~30%)", "over an assumed baseline of 0%", "Average (close friends): 7.75 / 10"
- **Observational statements**: "ChatSelm is eerily similar to me"

## Technical Writing Approach
- **Accessible explanations**: Breaks down complex concepts (QLoRA, Axolotl, ViT) in simple terms
- **Shows the process**: Documents failures, iterations, and debugging
- **Includes actual code/config**: Full code blocks with explanations
- **Explains "why"**: Not just what was done, but why choices were made
- **Shows errors**: Includes actual error messages and how they were solved
- **Before/after comparisons**: Shows progression through iterations
- **Cross-references other work**: "I used it in [freakcha]" - links to previous projects
- **Notes about environment**: "Note to anyone who's trying this in a Linux environment..."
- **Surprised by results**: "I was honestly impressed", "worked surprisingly well"

## Formatting Style
- **Bold for emphasis**: Key terms and important concepts, sometimes for entire phrases
- **Italics for emphasis**: Used for specific terms or casual emphasis ("_gesture recognition_")
- **Code blocks**: Extensive use with language tags and inline explanations
- **Blockquotes**: For definitions and explanations from sources, often multi-paragraph
- **Video content**: HTML video tags at the top with captions
- **Image references**: With descriptive alt text and captions, often multiple per post
- **Tables**: Extensive use for data presentation, comparisons, results (markdown tables with alignment)
- **Lists**: Both bulleted and numbered, used liberally, sometimes nested
- **Inline code**: Uses backticks for technical terms, file names, commands
- **Emojis**: Used sparingly in text (😮‍💨, 😭, 🤩) but more in examples
- **Figcaptions**: Used for all images/videos, often with personality: "Look how happy I am!", "My computer vision debut"
- **Answer keys**: Simple format like "AABBAAABBA" at the end
- **Sectioned data**: Groups related data (e.g., "Close friends" vs "Lesser-known friends")

## Narrative Style
- **Journey-focused**: Tells the story of the process, not just the result
- **Results-focused**: Can also present data-driven analysis and evaluations
- **Personal anecdotes**: Includes reactions, feelings, and personal context
- **Shows learning**: "I had no idea what any of the options meant", "I think learning vim was a pain in the ass but once you get used to it"
- **Conversational flow**: Natural transitions between topics
- **Balanced**: Shows both excitement and frustration equally
- **Methodology transparency**: Explains how experiments were set up and conducted
- **Honest about results**: "it performs well with short responses. Unfortunately, on longer responses it hallucinates"

## Specific Phrases & Patterns
- "But without Further Ado" (intentional capitalization quirk)
- "Lowkey" as opening modifier
- "Alright" as casual opening
- "Needless to say"

- "Such a mood. Wow. This is me."
- "It Works... Generally!" (section titles with uncertainty/honesty)
- "Some learning points!" (alternative conclusion format)
- "ChatSelm is eerily similar to me" (observational)
- "Let me know how many you get correct!" (call to action)
- Uses "lolz" instead of "lol"
- Mixes formal technical writing with very casual asides
